# Linear_Regression
Linear Regression using numpy

<B>Learning Objectives</B>
Create a linear model, and implement gradient descent.
Train the linear model fit given data using gradient descent.

<B>Project Structure</B>
The hands on project on Linear Regression with Python is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction
Introduction to the problem
Introduction to the Rhyme interface

Task 2: Dataset
Refresher on linear regression
Create a function to synthesize data

Task 3: Initialize Parameters
Continue the refresher on linear regression
Start writing the linear model class

Task 4: Forward Pass
Refresher on gradient descent
Implement the forward pass

Task 5: Compute Loss
Extend the linear model and add a function to compute loss

Task 6: Backward Pass
Implement a backward pass function
Calculate gradients dW and db

Task 7: Update Parameters
Update the parameter values with gradients obtained with backward pass

Task 8: Training Loop
Implement the final training loop
Train the model

Task 9: Predictions
Get predictions from the trained model
Get predictions from an untrained model for comparison
